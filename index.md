#### Background

I received my PhD in <a href="https://ccb.berkeley.edu/academics/phd-in-computational-biology/">Computational Biology</a> at UC Berkeley, advised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PySbfcEAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao">Rasmus Nielsen</a> and working closely with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SPXgieEAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao">Noah Zaitlen</a> at UCLA. My research focused on developing probabilistic models to infer the evolution of human genes & heritable traits. 

Previous to Afresh, I was a member of the Bioinformatics & Data Science team at <a href="https://grail.com/">GRAIL</a>, where I helped develop new post-diagnostic applications, and also interned at Ancestry DNA in 2017.
